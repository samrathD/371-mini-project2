This is our test file for our Mini-Project 2 in CMPT 371.
We are sending this using pipelining, flow control, and congestion control.
Following is generated by AI, some random text about networking, tcp and udp.

In essence, the digital communication landscape is built upon these two contrasting philosophies of data transmission. 
TCP operates much like a certified postal service, requiring signatures and tracking every package to ensure every item arrives intact and in the correct sequence. 
This meticulously careful approach, while slow to start and resource-intensive, provides peace of mind for critical data exchanges. 
It is the dependable foundation for the majority of the internet we use daily, from conducting secure online banking transactions to loading complex web pages, 
where corrupted or missing data is simply not an option.
Conversely, UDP resembles dropping a postcard into the nearest mailbox; it's fast, efficient, and requires no acknowledgement of receipt. 
The sender assumes the best and moves on immediately. While some postcards might get lost or delayed, the overall flow of information continues uninterrupted. 
This efficiency is vital for the immediacy of human interaction online. When you are on a voice call with a loved one or engrossed in an online game, a brief moment of 
silence or a single dropped frame is preferable to the jarring delay (lag) that would occur if the system paused to retransmit a lost packet.
The genius of network engineering lies in the strategic application of these protocols to their respective tasks. The internet, as we know it, 
is a complex tapestry woven from both threads. Developers choose TCP for functions that define the internet's reliability and information integrity, 
while simultaneously leveraging UDP for applications that power its real-time, interactive capabilities. This duality ensures that whether you are downloading 
a crucial business document or watching a live-streamed concert, the network is optimized for the specific task at hand, providing a seamless and functional 
digital experience.
Ultimately, the technical concepts of TCP and UDP perfectly mirror the broader idea of networking in general: building a structure 
or system optimized for the efficient and effective transfer of value, be it data packets or professional opportunities. Both are tools for connection, a
nd the most successful network implementations, whether human or digital, effectively balance the need for robust reliability with the desire for rapid, fluid communication. 
Understanding these core principles allows engineers and professionals alike to build systems that are resilient, fast, and capable of supporting the vast and varied 
demands of modern life.
